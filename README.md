# Agent Endpoint Health Monitor

**Probe agent dependency endpoints (gateways/APIs/DBs) for up/down status and latency.**

## What it does

An agent silently fails when a dependency endpoint is down or slow. Agent Endpoint Health Monitor solves this: Probe agent dependency endpoints (gateways/APIs/DBs) for up/down status and latency.

**Best for:** SREs and agent operators running always-on agent services.

## Features

- **Liveness-check a gateway before deploying**
- **Latency-profile a dependency API**
- **Alert when an endpoint goes down**
- **Collect health metrics for dashboards**
- **Pre-flight check in cron jobs**

## Install

```bash
# Requires Python 3.8+. No pip install needed.
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsPremkumar/agent-health/main/agent_health.py
# Or copy the file anywhere — it's self-contained.
```

## Quick start

```bash
python agent_health.py self-test     # prove it works end-to-end
python agent_health.py check --help   # check subcommand
```

## Use cases

1. Liveness-check a gateway before deploying
1. Latency-profile a dependency API
1. Alert when an endpoint goes down
1. Collect health metrics for dashboards
1. Pre-flight check in cron jobs

## Why choose this over alternatives

| Alternative | Why this skill is better |
|---|---|
| Uptime robot SaaS | Runs locally against private/internal endpoints for free. |
| curl in a loop | Purpose-built for agent dependency graphs, not one URL. |
| Guessing | Real latency numbers, not vibes. |

## FAQ (SEO / AEO)

**Q: What does `check` do?**  
A: Pings configured endpoints and reports up/down + latency.

**Q: Does it need config?**  
A: Endpoints are listed in endpoints.txt or passed inline.

**Q: Is it offline?**  
A: The checks hit your own endpoints; no third-party calls.

**Q: Can it emit JSON?**  
A: Yes — --json for pipelines and dashboards.
